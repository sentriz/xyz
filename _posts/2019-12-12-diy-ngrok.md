title: do-it-yourself ngrok alternative
---

if you:

<br>

- have a home server / vps
- use traefik
- use ngrok
- don't like spending money on ngrok for memorable subdomains

<br>

you can create your own

### step 1, the server

setup your traefik 1.x `frontends`/`backends`. in my case, I wanted `t-1.my.domain` and `t-2.my.domain`. two always available endpoints for whatever machine to connect to, which will be routed to a service my laptop.  
of course you could extend this config to as many tunnels as you like

```toml
# traefik.toml

[file]
[backends]
  [backends.t-1]
    [backends.t-1.servers.t-1]
    url = "http://localhost:51401"
  [backends.t-2]
    [backends.t-2.servers.t-2]
    url = "http://localhost:51402"
[frontends]
  [frontends.t-1]
  backend = "t-1"
  passHostHeader = true
    [frontends.t-1.routes.t-1]
    rule = "Host:t-1.my.domain
  [frontends.t-2]
  backend = "t-2"
  passHostHeader = true
    [frontends.t-2.routes.t-2]
    rule = "Host:t-2.my.domain"
```

- for the frontends, I picked a high enough local ports that they hopefully won't clash with any other service running on the server
- I'm also doing a `passHostHeader = true` for each backend, so that the request headers for the local proxied-to services have the public frontend hosts instead of `localhost`
- to make the public `t-*.my.domain` possible for my home server, I've got DNS similar to:
```
A      my.domain    <home_ip>
CNAME  *.my.domain  my.domain
```
and a DDNS client updating the `A` record, and `80`/`443` forwarded
- `acme` should be configured, giving you TLS for a proper ngrok alternative

### step 2, the client

it's as simple as 

<br>

`ssh -N -R '<traefik_backend_port>:localhost:<local_service_port>' <your_box>`

for every tunnel you want to create. no need for any extra binaries like with ngrok

<br>

- the `-N` means don't run any remote commands, so you won't get a shell on box. ssh will just keep the tunnel open without printing until you kill it
- the `-R` is key. connections to the given port on the remote host (`<traefik_backend_port>`) are to be forwarded to the local side (`localhost:<local_service_port>`

<br>

so in my case, if I want to show a friend a web server I have running at `http://localhost:5454` by the more friendly and secure address `https://t-1.my.domain`, it would be:  

<br>

`ssh -N -R '51401:localhost:5454' my-box`

<br>

where `51401` matches the frontend in the `traefik.toml`

<br>

much better :)
